Firstly you have to install packages for nav2 and turtlebot3 as u already know using this command 

sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2 ros-humble-nav2-bringup ros-humble-turtlebot3*



There are some issues with Nav2 stack in ros2 humble in loading the map. here is the solution for that.

1st fix:

we need to change the DDS from fast DDS to cyclocne DDS.

to install cyclone DDS use command:

sudo apt update

Now install cycloneDDS using the command

sudo apt install ros-humble-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp

Now after insalling this DDS we need to tell ros to use this DDS.

to do this we need to export the enviromnt

to do this to bashrc script and write some commands:

export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle

export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp

And the second thing to do is to modify a parameter file where the turtlebot3 navigation package is installed.

go to /opt/ros/humble

if you want get parameters files for the installed package you go to share folder

/opt/ros/humble/share

Go to below location

/opt/ros/humble/share/turtlebot3_navigation2/param

you will see all the .yaml file for all the models.



we are using waffle model then we need to edit this file using the command;

sudo gedit waffle.yaml



in the file you need to search for robot_model_type

and chnage th emodel ttpe to nav2_amcl::DifferentialMotionModel

First need to start the robot using command:

ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py

Now we going to start the navigation for the robot using command :

ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py use_sim_time:=True map:=maps/my_map.yaml

It will open Rviz software and loaded map.

Now use 2D pose Estimate at upper bar and select the starting position of robot and orientation according to the gazbo.

and verify the map position according to the gazbo simlation tool in the Rviz.

Now click on Nav2 Goal to give robot new destrination point and orientation.





i am sharing the package "turtlebot3_gazebo" also with you. 

i have already generated the map i will provide also with the folder name "maps"



it will start the robot in the world in gazebo.




Now you can replace the controller which is on this website :
https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2_tutorials/tree/humble/nav2_pure_pursuit_controller

and chnage the parameters in this "turtlebot3_navigation2/src/turtlebot3_navigation2/param/waffle.yaml" to use the new controller. 

and apply the task which i told you. 

JazakAllah.
